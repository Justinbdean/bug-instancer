This script was a project I worked on a part of an independent study during the spring quarter of 2024. I worked along side a class producing a short animation project which involved little bug like robots in their shots. Some artists were having to many copies of their bugs in their shots. The professor running my independent study was also running this production class. He suggested I create a tool that would help the artists create these groups of bugs, posisiton them, and have them be instances. This project utilizes pythong and the maya library. I would still like to add more features to the tool, though since the class has ended I will have to come back to this when I have time.
